## Ravenous

### A React application for finding nearby restaurants and businesses.

```
git clone
npm install
npm start
```
You will need to obtain an API key for Yelp. In the projects src/ directory, create a file called config.js. Create an object and insert your client ID and client secret key, then export the object. Replace the clientID and secret variables in yelp.js with your personal keys and the app should run fine.
